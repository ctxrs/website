# RTK workflow coverage

Sift is an independent tool-output compressor. Generic execution covers many
of the same programs as RTK, but does not reproduce RTK's command-specific
parsers, summaries or flags. This page describes the current source; it
does not claim complete parity with every RTK command variant.

| Workflow | Sift's current choice |
| --- | --- |
| Git, GitHub, builds, tests, linters, package managers, containers, cloud CLIs and search | `sift COMMAND ARG...` or `sift run -- COMMAND ARG...` forwards native argv. Generic compaction preserves text bytes or supported JSON values. Ordinary Git status and Cargo tests also have concise presentations, described below. |
| Long finite commands / terminal invocation | `sift run --capture -- COMMAND ...` waits for complete output within a combined 8 MiB bound, including terminal invocation. Progress is delayed; overflow switches to raw output. Default execution keeps interactive/progress passthrough. |
| Automatic integration | Completion adapters replace eligible final text; pre-execution adapters rewrite supported literal POSIX commands. Unsupported syntax stays unchanged. Gemini/VS Code rewrites are withheld for demonstrated approval-rule regressions; Cursor/Droid await qualification. Host qualification and scopes are listed in [INTEGRATIONS.md](INTEGRATIONS.md). |
| Migrate RTK setup | `sift init --replace-rtk --dry-run`, then `sift init --replace-rtk`. Stock recognition, exact backups and preservation of unrelated settings; unsupported automatic migrations keep RTK active. |
| Plain input / streaming input | `compact`, `pipe` and plain `read` compact one file or stdin. `filter [--capture]` provides bounded stdin buffering and raw fallback. These do not load named RTK filters. |
| Selected file/JSON views | `read --from N --lines N --grep TEXT`; `json --pointer POINTER --field KEY --limit N`. Selection is explicit and can omit information. No implicit depth/string elision. |
| Summary / diagnostic / test views | `summary -- COMMAND`, `err -- COMMAND`, `test -- COMMAND`. Explicit head/tail or keyword/context views with omission labels; no inferred test result or tool-specific parser. |
| Persistent compaction | `compact --protocol=json-v1`; one tokenizer initialization, one response per input line. |
| Raw output | `proxy COMMAND ...` or `run --raw -- COMMAND ...`. |
| Recovery | Explicit-encoding restoration, or opt-in originals through `recall`. Recall accepts unique ID prefixes, line windows and literal grep; retention caps are configurable. No rerun for recovery. |
| Local statistics | `gain` supports project, date, command and source filters, daily/weekly/monthly buckets, history, graph, JSON and CSV. Reports describe retained records; unmeasured output stays unmeasured. |
| Opportunity discovery | `discover FILE...` measures selected saved output. `discover --history PATH --suggest` inspects supported saved Claude/Codex histories and reports observed correction patterns without executing commands or writing rules. |
| Observed usage/cost import | `ccusage --import FILE` reports a selected local export separately from Sift's measured gain. Costs retain their source qualification; no projected savings or package fetching. |
| Setup diagnostics | `doctor` checks configured registration, executable availability and Sift settings. It does not prove the host loaded or trusted an adapter. |
| Distribution | Release binaries and curl/PowerShell installers, plus source builds and a source Homebrew formula. Signed/notarized macOS and Authenticode Windows releases, static Linux binaries. |

## Migrating command lines

Changing the executable name alone is not a supported migration. In particular,
RTK's raw `run` and Sift's compacting `run` have different meanings.

| Existing intent | Sift command |
| --- | --- |
| Run with raw output | `sift proxy git diff` |
| Execute a shell string | `sift run -- sh -c 'git log | tail -5'` |
| Inspect test diagnostics | `sift test --context 3 -- cargo test` |
| Invoke the native `test` utility | `sift run -- test -f README.md` |
| Read a selected file window | `sift read FILE --from 20 --lines 40` |
| Select JSON rows/fields | `sift json FILE --pointer /items --field name --limit 10` |
| Run an installed package-local tool | `sift pnpm exec tsc` or `sift npx --no-install tsc` |
| Use a user-chosen filter | `your-command | your-filter | sift compact` |

Pass argv as separate arguments. `proxy 'git diff'` names one executable; it does
not parse a shell string. Sift does not translate RTK's `run -c`, `read --level`,
`--ultra-compact`, named `pipe` filters, formatter detection or tool-specific
flags. Choose native flags, an explicit view, or a filter you already use.
Package-runner behavior remains the responsibility of the runner you select.

## Retained differences and limits

- **Preservation and command presentations.** Generic compaction keeps all
  supplied text bytes or supported JSON values. Ordinary Git status keeps all
  displayed paths and states with shorter formatting. Validated Cargo test
  output can omit passing test rows, with an omission count; failures, ignored
  tests and diagnostics remain. These command presentations must beat the
  reversible candidate by complete token count. Opt-in views can omit content;
  their output is not reversible compaction. Diagnostic/test views are heuristics,
  not replacements for RTK's framework parsers, parsed failure totals, cloud
  summaries or source-code views. Savings and convenience vary by workload.
- **Structured formats.** JSON compaction supports complete values and uniform
  top-level object arrays. JSON Pointer/field views add explicit selection, not
  YAML/XML/CSV/JSONL semantic codecs, nested-row factoring, SQL tables or schema
  inference. Other formats can still use reversible text compaction.
- **Execution and policy.** No deny-and-retry integration, blanket permission rule
  or automatic package fetch. Pre-execution rewrites cover a limited literal POSIX
  grammar; they do not establish universal permission equivalence. Codex on Unix
  does not expose the requested shell to the hook, so non-POSIX requests require
  disabling the pre-hook and using manual `sift run`. On Unix,
  signal exits become numeric `128 + signal` rather than re-raising the signal in
  Sift. Separate stdout/stderr are preserved, not their total interleaving.
- **Custom filtering.** No custom TOML filter DSL, filter autoloading or trust
  framework. Explicit native filters compose with `compact`; Sift does not
  silently load project-supplied filters.
- **Reporting.** No projected bills, subscription/quota estimates or claims of
  fewer agent turns. Imported ccusage amounts may be calculated or incompletely
  priced. History suggestions cover known correction patterns; they do not
  learn general rules, join every asynchronous result or prove integration adoption.
  Dedicated recall-efficiency and host-decision audit reports are not implemented.
- **Local state.** No telemetry, summarization model, background daemon or automatic
  history scan. Original retention is opt-in. Sift does not import RTK's analytics
  database or recall store; migration leaves those files and the RTK executable
  available so you can read them with RTK.

Windows executable lookup includes `.exe`, `.com`, `.cmd` and `.bat` through
PATH/PATHEXT; PowerShell scripts need an explicit interpreter. The exact Windows
x64 release passed native batch-shim, argv/stream/status,
finite-capture and console-input/output checks. The runner suite also covered
Ctrl+Break, descendant cleanup and detached background children. These are scoped
Windows GNU binary checks, not MSVC runtime or arbitrary terminal job-control
qualification.

Do not alias `rtk` to `sift`. Keep existing integrations until their replacement
scope and host activation are confirmed.
